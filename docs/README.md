## Homelab Documentation

> The place to document all things about my learnings regarding my Homelab Setup.

## What it is

My Homelab (here is a great [Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/)) journey which started with one Raspberry Pi 4 2GB has become more complicated and more powerful over the years. I started with just a SMB share to store my CCTV files and now I have many services like HomeAssistant, openHAB, Plex, Radarr, Sonarr etc. are running from various devices 24x7. Homelab journies are oftern difficult and you have to browse through a lot of documentation before things start to work out. The goal of this documentation website is to just offer one more place for people to get tutorials and help themselves out. 

## Services I run

- [OpenMediaVault](https://www.openmediavault.org/) - An opensource NAS solution with much more to offer
- [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) - A home automation system with power of opensource
- [openHAB](https://www.openhab.org/) - Another open source home automation system with powerful features
- [Plex](https://www.plex.tv) - A local media organizer with Netflix like interface
- more on the way....
